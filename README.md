# Yaht-Z Flush

## Overview
A new twist on the classic dice game! The dice now have each number in 2 possible colors.\
When all 5 dice are the same color, you have rolled a FLUSH and scores for that round are doubled!

For each round, you can roll the dice up to 3 times. Click any dice to select them and prevent them from being rolled.\
Click again to deselect. When you are ready to submit your score for the round, click the desired category in the scorecard and press PLAY.
