# Yaht-Z Flush

## Overview
A new twist on the classic dice game! The dice now have each number in 2 possible colors.\
When all 5 dice are the same color, you have rolled a FLUSH and scores for that round are doubled!

For each round, you can roll the dice up to 3 times. Click any dice to select them and prevent them from being rolled.\
Click again to deselect. When you are ready to submit your score for the round, click the desired category in the scorecard and press PLAY.

\* If you roll a Yaht-Z and that category is unavailable, you can count it as a Full House, Sm Straight, or Lg Straight

\*\* If you roll a Yaht-Z and have already entered a non-zero score for that category,  you get an additional Yaht-Z bonus of 100 points. If it's also a flush, the bonus is worth 200 points! This Yaht-Z bonus can be earned multiple times, for each additional Yaht-Z.
